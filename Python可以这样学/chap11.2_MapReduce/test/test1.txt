The day was fresh, with a lively spring wind full ofdust. All the old ladies in both families had got outtheir faded sables and yellowing ermines, and the smellof camphor from the front pews almost smothered thefaint spring scent of the lilies banking the altar.


Newland Archer, at a signal from the sexton, hadcome out of the vestry and placed himself with his bestman on the chancel step of Grace Church.



The signal meant that the brougham bearing thebride and her father was in sight; but there was sure tobe a considerable interval of adjustment and consultationin the lobby, where the bridesmaids were alreadyhovering like a cluster of Easter blossoms. During thisunavoidable lapse of time the bridegroom, in proof ofhis eagerness, was expected to expose himself alone tothe gaze of the assembled company; and Archer hadgone through this formality as resignedly as through allthe others which made of a nineteenth century NewYork wedding a rite that seemed to belong to the dawnof history. Everything was equally easy--or equallypainful, as one chose to put it--in the path he wascommitted to tread, and he had obeyed the flurriedinjunctions of his best man as piously as other bridegroomshad obeyed his own, in the days when he hadguided them through the same labyrinth.



So far he was reasonably sure of having fulfilled allhis obligations. The bridesmaids' eight bouquets of whitelilac and lilies-of-the-valley had been sent in due time,as well as the gold and sapphire sleeve-links of theeight ushers and the best man's cat's-eye scarf-pin;Archer had sat up half the night trying to vary thewording of his thanks for the last batch of presentsfrom men friends and ex-lady-loves; the fees for theBishop and the Rector were safely in the pocket of hisbest man; his own luggage was already at Mrs. MansonMingott's, where the wedding-breakfast was totake place, and so were the travelling clothes into whichhe was to change; and a private compartment had beenengaged in the train that was to carry the young coupleto their unknown destination--concealment of the spotin which the bridal night was to be spent being one ofthe most sacred taboos of the prehistoric ritual.



"Got the ring all right?" whispered young van derLuyden Newland, who was inexperienced in the dutiesof a best man, and awed by the weight of his responsibility.



Archer made the gesture which he had seen so manybridegrooms make: with his ungloved right hand hefelt in the pocket of his dark grey waistcoat, and assuredhimself that the little gold circlet (engravedinside: Newland to May, April ---, 187-) was in itsplace; then, resuming his former attitude, his tall hatand pearl-grey gloves with black stitchings grasped inhis left hand, he stood looking at the door of thechurch.

 

Overhead, Handel's March swelled pompously throughthe imitation stone vaulting, carrying on its waves thefaded drift of the many weddings at which, with cheerfulindifference, he had stood on the same chancel stepwatching other brides float up the nave toward otherbridegrooms.
