Archer wondered how many flaws Lefferts's keeneyes would discover in the ritual of his divinity; then hesuddenly recalled that he too had once thought suchquestions important. The things that had filled his daysseemed now like a nursery parody of life, or like thewrangles of mediaeval schoolmen over metaphysical termsthat nobody had ever understood. A stormy discussionas to whether the wedding presents should be "shown"had darkened the last hours before the wedding; and itseemed inconceivable to Archer that grown-up peopleshould work themselves into a state of agitation oversuch trifles, and that the matter should have been decided(in the negative) by Mrs. Welland's saying, withindignant tears: "I should as soon turn the reportersloose in my house." Yet there was a time when Archerhad had definite and rather aggressive opinions on allsuch problems, and when everything concerning themanners and customs of his little tribe had seemed tohim fraught with world-wide significance.

 

"And all the while, I suppose," he thought, "realpeople were living somewhere, and real things happeningto them . . ."



"THERE THEY COME!" breathed the best man excitedly;but the bridegroom knew better.



The cautious opening of the door of the churchmeant only that Mr. Brown the livery-stable keeper(gowned in black in his intermittent character of sexton)was taking a preliminary survey of the scene beforemarshalling his forces. The door was softly shutagain; then after another interval it swung majesticallyopen, and a murmur ran through the church: "Thefamily!"



Mrs. Welland came first, on the arm of her eldestson. Her large pink face was appropriately solemn, andher plum-coloured satin with pale blue side-panels, andblue ostrich plumes in a small satin bonnet, met withgeneral approval; but before she had settled herselfwith a stately rustle in the pew opposite Mrs. Archer'sthe spectators were craning their necks to see who wascoming after her. Wild rumours had been abroad theday before to the effect that Mrs. Manson Mingott, inspite of her physical disabilities, had resolved on beingpresent at the ceremony; and the idea was so much inkeeping with her sporting character that bets ran highat the clubs as to her being able to walk up the naveand squeeze into a seat. It was known that she hadinsisted on sending her own carpenter to look into thepossibility of taking down the end panel of the frontpew, and to measure the space between the seat andthe front; but the result had been discouraging, and forone anxious day her family had watched her dallyingwith the plan of being wheeled up the nave in herenormous Bath chair and sitting enthroned in it at thefoot of the chancel.



The idea of this monstrous exposure of her personwas so painful to her relations that they could havecovered with gold the ingenious person who suddenlydiscovered that the chair was too wide to pass betweenthe iron uprights of the awning which extended fromthe church door to the curbstone. The idea of doingaway with this awning, and revealing the bride to themob of dressmakers and newspaper reporters who stoodoutside fighting to get near the joints of the canvas,exceeded even old Catherine's courage, though for amoment she had weighed the possibility. "Why, theymight take a photograph of my child AND PUT IT IN THEPAPERS!" Mrs. Welland exclaimed when her mother'slast plan was hinted to her; and from this unthinkableindecency the clan recoiled with a collective shudder.The ancestress had had to give in; but her concessionwas bought only by the promise that the wedding-breakfast should take place under her roof, though (asthe Washington Square connection said) with theWellands' house in easy reach it was hard to have to makea special price with Brown to drive one to the otherend of nowhere.
