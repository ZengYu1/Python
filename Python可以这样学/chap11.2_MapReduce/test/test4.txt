Though all these transactions had been widelyreported by the Jacksons a sporting minority still clungto the belief that old Catherine would appear in church,and there was a distinct lowering of the temperaturewhen she was found to have been replaced by herdaughter-in-law. Mrs. Lovell Mingott had the high colourand glassy stare induced in ladies of her age andhabit by the effort of getting into a new dress; but oncethe disappointment occasioned by her mother-in-law'snon-appearance had subsided, it was agreed that herblack Chantilly over lilac satin, with a bonnet of Parmaviolets, formed the happiest contrast to Mrs. Welland'sblue and plum-colour. Far different was the impressionproduced by the gaunt and mincing lady who followedon Mr. Mingott's arm, in a wild dishevelment of stripesand fringes and floating scarves; and as this last apparitionglided into view Archer's heart contracted andstopped beating.



He had taken it for granted that the MarchionessManson was still in Washington, where she had gonesome four weeks previously with her niece, MadameOlenska. It was generally understood that their abruptdeparture was due to Madame Olenska's desire to removeher aunt from the baleful eloquence of Dr. AgathonCarver, who had nearly succeeded in enlisting her as arecruit for the Valley of Love; and in the circumstancesno one had expected either of the ladies to return forthe wedding. For a moment Archer stood with his eyesfixed on Medora's fantastic figure, straining to see whocame behind her; but the little procession was at anend, for all the lesser members of the family had takentheir seats, and the eight tall ushers, gathering themselvestogether like birds or insects preparing for somemigratory manoeuvre, were already slipping throughthe side doors into the lobby.



"Newland--I say: SHE'S HERE!" the best man whispered.



Archer roused himself with a start.



A long time had apparently passed since his hearthad stopped beating, for the white and rosy processionwas in fact half way up the nave, the Bishop, theRector and two white-winged assistants were hoveringabout the flower-banked altar, and the first chords ofthe Spohr symphony were strewing their flower-likenotes before the bride.



Archer opened his eyes (but could they really havebeen shut, as he imagined?), and felt his heart beginningto resume its usual task. The music, the scent ofthe lilies on the altar, the vision of the cloud of tulleand orange-blossoms floating nearer and nearer, thesight of Mrs. Archer's face suddenly convulsed withhappy sobs, the low benedictory murmur of the Rector'svoice, the ordered evolutions of the eight pinkbridesmaids and the eight black ushers: all these sights,sounds and sensations, so familiar in themselves, sounutterably strange and meaningless in his new relationto them, were confusedly mingled in his brain.
